							<h1>Hiya! I'm Delanie! :D</h1>
							<p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet!<br />
								This website serves as a form of autobiography for those who want to get to know me!</p>

							<h2>Bio</h2>
							<p>I'm an American model, influencer, and content creator based in Tampa, Florida.<br />
								I'm also a college student studying East Asian Languages & Cultures at the University of South Florida.<br /> 
								I'm also a huge weeb and can speak conversational Japanese as a result of my studies at USF. 簡単な文法と単語しか使えませんが</p>
							<p>
								I'm known online for my authenticity, as I just like to be myself and have fun!<br />
								I always encourage those around me to be the best versions of themselves they can be, as I believe that the more you align your life with your true self, the more you'll love living!<br />
								I value honesty and open-mindedness, especially because I know my career choice is unorthodox, and I strive to show others that sex workers are not always the stereotypes you hear online. </p>
							<p>
								My hobbies include sewing, graphic design, making stickers, making posters, interior design, watching anime, and of course, studying Japanese! I do all of this while focusing on my career, taking care of my house, hanging out with my friends, and spoiling my boyfriend hehe. Oh and I also have a crested gecko, her name is Stick! :D</p>

							<h2>OnlyFans Services</h2>
							<p>
								If you follow me on <a href="https://onlyfans.com/dela_kou">OnlyFans</a>, here's a list of my services! Thank you so much for your support, love you!! <3<br />
								P.S. If you choose to buy one of my services, consider paying me on CashApp, as OnlyFans takes a huge cut of my profits (make sure you put your OnlyFans username in the comments of your payment). However, please dont mention this anywhere on my OnlyFans, as it could get me banned! Keep it on the down low for me. If need, talk about CashApp on my Discord.

								<h3>Tip Menu</h3>
								<p>
									Work in progress... 
								</p>
								<h3>Shower Streams</h3>
								<p>
									Twice a week, I stream my morning shower on OnlyFans, where you guys can come interact with me!<br />
									The schedule and alerts of when I stream are in my <a href="https://discord.gg/JYnhYtp48v">Discord</a>!</p>
								<p>
									Streams have no audio, and feature only video. I can respond to yes-or-no questions that you ask in chat.<br />
									Streams are usually 30-40 minutes long, and occasionally go over if enough tips are involved.<br />
									Tips can be sent with a hidden message that only I can see. This is where you can ask me to do stuff on stream!
								</p>
								<h3>PPV / Sextapes</h3>
								<p>
									PPV stands for Pay Per View. These are exclusive videos that are additional to my usual content. These videos are usually sextapes, featuring my boyfriend :3</p>
								<p>
									I will post on <a href="https://onlyfans.com/dela_kou">OnlyFans</a> and <a href="https://discord.gg/JYnhYtp48v">Discord</a> when a new PPV is available. You can also see a list of current ones for sale in the "For Sale" tag on my OnlyFans.
								</p>
								<h3>Customs</h3>
								<p>
									Commissioning a custom is your opportunity to get a video of me doing whatever you want. These videos are for your eyes only. Pricing is as follows:<br />
									<ul>
										<li>Base price $30 USD per minute. Includes dressing up, showing off, posing, etc.</li>
										<li>If a toy is involved (vibe, dildo, plug, etc), $50 per minute.</li>
										<li>If your instruction includes me finishing, add $50 on top of the $50 per minute (as I cannot without a vibe).</li>
									</ul>
									Customs are a hot commodity, meaning that if you ask for a custom, there's not a 100% chance I'll get the chance to film it. There's also not a defined time frame in which you'll recieve your video. If you want a higher chance of getting your custom earlier, consider putting more money on the table.<br />
									If I accept your custom, I'll add it to my to-do list, and will contact you once it has been filmed. Then, we can discuss pricing. If you choose not to buy it, I'll reuse it as PPV. </p>
								<p>
									There are some rules as to what I will and will not do in a custom:<br />
									<ul>
										<li>I will dress up however you wish, given I have the clothing necessary. <a href="closet">Here</a>'s a database of what I have so far! If you don't see something you like, consider suggesting a wish on my <a href="https://throne.com/delakou">Throne</a>!</li>
										<li>I will include my boyfriend if you wish, but the price will double.</li>
										<li><u>I will not have sex</u>. These acts are reserved for sextapes.</li>
										<li>I will not hit myself, including my ass.</li>
										<li>I will not fake an emotion, or pretend to enjoy something.</li>
										<li>I will not impersonate a person. Real or fictional.</li>
										<li>I will not write words on body/paper/etc.</li>
										<li>I will not say a name including yours or mine or someone else's.</li>
										<li>I will not wear makeup (this applies to all of my content, it's a personal preference).</li>
										<li>This is obvious, but I will not break OnlyFans' Terms of Service. This includes using objects as toys (that aren't made for that purpose), being naked in public (excludes nature), hate speech, promoting violence, or anything illegal.</li>
									</ul>
									If you're unsure about the rules, just ask!<br />
									I have the right to refuse any custom that I do not feel comfortable accepting, no matter the reasoning. 
								</p>
								<h3>Custom Sextapes</h3>
								<p>
									This is an experimental feature that I'm working on!<br />
									Once a month I will hold a bid auction on my <a href="https://discord.gg/JYnhYtp48v">Discord</a> for a custom sextape. The <u>starting bid is $1,000 USD</u>. The same rules apply, except now the 3rd rule has been waved. You get to tell my boyfriend and I what to do, as long as we both accept your proposal. Again, my boyfriend amd I have the right to refuse any custom that we do not feel comfortable accepting, no matter the reasoning. We will work with you to create something worthwhile.
