							<h1>Hiya! I'm Delanie! :D</h1>
							<p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet!<br />
								This website serves as a form of autobiography for those who want to get to know me!</p>

							<h2>Bio</h2>
							<p>I'm an American model, influencer, and content creator based in Tampa, Florida.<br />
								I'm also a college student studing East Asian Languages & Cultures at the University of South Florida.<br /> 
								I'm also a huge weeb and can speak conversational Japanese as a result of my studies at USF. 簡単な文法と単語しか使えませんが
							</p>
							<p>I'm known online for my authenticity, as I just like to be myself and have fun!<br />
								I always encourage those around me to be the best versions of themselves they can be, as I believe that the more you align your life with your true self, the more you'll love living!<br />
								I value honesty and open-mindedness, especially because I know my career choice is unorthodox, and I strive to show others that sex workers are not always the stereotypes you hear online.

							<h2>OnlyFans</h2>
							<p>If you follow me on <a href="https://onlyfans.com/dela_kou">OnlyFans</a>, here's a list of my services!<br />
								Thank you so much for your support, love you!! <3
							</p>
							<h3>Tip Menu</h3>
							<p>
								Coming soon!
							</p>
							<h3>Shower Streams</h3>
							<p>
								Twice a week, I stream my morning shower on OnlyFans, where you guys can come interact with me!<br />
								The schedule and alerts of when I stream are in my <a href="https://discord.gg/JYnhYtp48v">Discord</a>!</p>
							<p>
								Streams have no audio, and feature only video. I can respond to yes-or-no questions that you ask in chat.<br />
								Streams are usually 40 minutes long, and don't ask for them to be longer, as I usually have breakfast plans right after lol.<br />
								Tips can be sent with a hidden message that only I can see. This is where you can ask me to do stuff on stream!<br />
							</p>
							<p>   </p>
							<h3>Customs</h3>
							<p>
								Commissioning a custom video is your opportunity to get a video of me doing whatever you want. These videos are for your eyes only, but because of this, they are very expensive. Each custom is a minimum of $100 USD.
							</p>
							<p>
								There are some rules as to what I will and will not do in a custom:<br />
								<ul>
									<li>I will dress up however you wish, given I have the clothing necessary.</li>
									<li>I will not hit myself, including my ass.</li>
									<li>I will not fake an emotion, or pretend to enjoy something.</li>
									<li>I will not impersonate a person. Real or fictional.</li>
									<li>I will not write words on body/paper/etc.</li>
									<li>I will not say a name including yours or mine or someone else's.</li>
									<li>I will not wear makeup (this applies to all of my content, it's a personal preference).</li>
									<li>This is obvious, but I will not break OnlyFans' Terms of Service. This includes using objects as toys (that aren't made for that purpose), being naaked in public (excludes nature), hate speech, promoting violence, or anything illegal.</li>
								</ul>
								If you're unsure about the rules, just ask!<br />
								I have the right to refuse any custom that I do not feel comfortable accepting, no matter the reasoning.
